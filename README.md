# Steoreo-Matching

Stereo Matching is the process of recovering 3D structures of real world from 2D images. It has been widely used in areas such as autonomous driving, augmented reality and robotics navigation. 

Given a pair of rectified stereo images, the goal of this project is to compute the disparity for each pixel in the reference image, where disparity is defined as the horizontal displacement between a pair of corresponding pixels in the left and right images.
